### Technical Details ###
* Creating and deleting Hauntlists proved to be a particularly tricky issue for us, as our goal was to have a user edit and delete Hauntlists dynamically without the need to refresh the page. In reference to checkboxes, we struggled to find a way to change a parent list item in the presence of a child checked box. The CSS selector :has, which can target parent elements of children, is only supported by Safari. Thus we had to come up with a more creative solution: storing a querySelectorAll in a variable to iterate through all li elements, removing those links with a checked box using .contains() and .remove().
```
    //remove all lis with a checked check box

    const list = document.querySelectorAll("li");
    const checked = document.querySelectorAll(":checked");

        list.forEach(li => {
          checked.forEach(checked => {
            if(li.contains(checked)) li.remove()

          })
        })



```
* Another issue we encountered with deleting Haunt Lists was the difficulty of deleting a cookie server side. The typical method of setting its expiration date to some time in the past was not working for us. Instead, we had to use the alternative method of setting the cookie’s original max age to -1.
```
const logoutUser = (req, res) => {
  delete req.session.auth;
  req.session.cookie.originalMaxAge = -1;
};

```
* A large, app-breaking issue we were struggling with involved 500 errors with our routes while editing or deleting reviews. The error received stated,  “Can't set headers after they are sent." This was a particularly nefarious issue, since it would go relatively unnoticed running locally. However, this would break the performance of the application when pushed to Heroku, and would stop all functioning.
We learned that setting our request methods to GET would ensure that functions would not try to set a header after part of the body had already been written.


```
// EDIT review data - /reviews/:reviewId
router.post('/:id(\\d+)', csrfProtection, reviewValidator, asyncHandler(async(req, res) => {
    //TODO: deconstruct form data from review
    const reviewId = req.params.id;
    const { userId, hauntId, score, review } = req.body;
    const reviewToUpdate = await Review.findByPk(+reviewId)
    const haunt = await Haunt.findByPk(+hauntId);

    const validationErrors = validationResult(req);
    let errors = [];
    // await creating a new review with deconstructed data
    if (validationErrors.isEmpty()) {
        await reviewToUpdate.update({
            reviewId,
            userId,
            hauntId,
            review,
            score
        });

        if (reviewToUpdate) {
            await reviewToUpdate.save();
            await averageScore(+hauntId);
            req.method = "GET";
            return res.redirect(`/haunts/${+hauntId}`);
        }
        errors.push("Editing failed");
    } else {
        errors = validationErrors.array().map(err => err.msg);
    }
    res.render("edit-review", { review, score, haunt, csrfToken: req.csrfToken(), errors }); // might need to feed hauntId
}));

// DELETE review
router.delete('/:id(\\d+)', asyncHandler(async(req, res, next) => {

    const reviewId = req.params.id;
    const review = await Review.findByPk(+reviewId);
    const hauntId = review.hauntId;

    if (review) {

        await review.destroy();
        req.method = "GET";
        return res.redirect(`/haunts/${+hauntId}`);

    } else {
        const err = Error(`Review with an id of ${reviewId} could not be found.`);
        err.title = "Review not found.";
        err.status = 404;
        return err;
    }
}));
